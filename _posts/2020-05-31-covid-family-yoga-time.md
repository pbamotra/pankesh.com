It’s been 10 years since I left my hometown. Only on handful of days during those years I’ve skipped calling my parents over phone. The ongoing epidemic has kept me at home and so I had to devise a plan to use my family time to cheer myself up and relax. I found my answer in - Yoga.

All I had to do was to convince my parents to spend the first hour of their day video calling my brother and I. 👀 In my previous experience with executing health related experiments with my family, I’ve realised that they obey by what I call as ‘The principle of least effort’. According to this principle, the lower a task's effort, the more likely it's to get accomplished. To overcome the mental barrier of having to carve out time for health, I asked them to give me 3 days to guide them into an actual healthy routine. Ofcourse once 3 days had passed, I asked everyone for 3 weeks. 😈 And, here we are today in the 6th week of our yoga routine which I describe next.

Before I started with this experiment, I was new to Yoga. Given that I could ask my family to carve out a limited amount of time, I had to devise a plan that was easy and took less than an hour, preferably half. While yoga is at times about performing complex āsanas, I wanted something easier so that we could "consistently" do it together over WhatsApp. That is when I stumbled on the following video on YouTube. It consists of simple warmup exercises followed by Sūrya Namaskār (Sun salutation), and Prāṇāyāma (breathing exercises). Simple and effective.

The warmup is pretty basic starting with rotations of the head and limbs. This is followed by a simple sequence of asanas including Tadasana, Urdhva Hastasana, Uttanasana, Uttanasana with head up, Adho Mukha Svanasana, Urdhva Mukha Svanasana, Chaturanga Dandasana, and then reversing the sequence to return to Tadasana. This is demonstrated well in the picture below.

The whole sequence takes about 5 minutes or so and then we move on to breathing exercises. It starts with Bhastrikā Prāṇāyāma (5 minutes), Anuloma Prāṇāyāma (5 minutes), Kapālabhāti (5 minutes), Ujjayi breathing (5 minutes), ending with a 5 minute session of Bhramari (buzzing like a bee). All these exercises are explained well in the Youtube video above. We have completed 40 sessions of Prāṇāyāma in the last 45 days which I never thought I could pull off with my family over video calls. The 5 minute sessions are not so boring either, we often make fun of each other dozing off to sleep  between the exercises because these exercises are so refreshing and calming at the same time. I'm going to carry on this tradition like the one I have carried on for the last 10 years. I’m thankful to my family that we could make something positive out of the ongoing epidemic crisis.

Cheers. 🥂
